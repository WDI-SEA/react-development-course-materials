This is Unit 6 of the complete React Development course. It includes the following:

1) **React ATM Application**: Lab

2) **Idea Board**: Code-along

3) **Final Project**: Prompt for students

4) **Project Presentations**: Info for instructors about class presentations

Notes:
- Item 2 is the code-along script for the instructor (except for the introductory slides, not student-facing).
- Item 2 is a code-along that requires approximately six hours to complete, so plan accordingly. For 10-week deliveries, the activity will take up three full class sessions.
