These are instructor notes to help guide a review discussion of [Film Project, Part 3](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/blob/master/03-Underlying%20Concepts/05-film-project-part3.mdblob/master/02-React%20State/12-film-project-part2.md).

**As you review, remember to ask students, "What questions do you have?" instead of "Do you have any questions?"**


Notes to cover in homework review:

- The previous film project assignment focuses heavily on lifting state up.  Make sure that students properly switch state to props where necessary.

- Review Step 8 where students set up a conditional for adding or removing films from `faves`.

- Remind students that functions can also be passed down the component tree and used in props.
