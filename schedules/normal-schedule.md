Note: anything that says "exercise", the student can also just self study in class (as some of it has videos)

----
## General breakdown:
----

- There are 5 repos to go through sequentially. These have lectures, exercises, and projects.
  - Most lessons have code that the student needs to follow along with. **Assume if there is code on screen, the student will be following along with you.**
- Then, there are 2 exercise repos where students are given an existing code base and told to add a feature.
- Then, there is 1 documentation repo - which has a group exercise.
- Then, there is 1 self project, which takes an entire day.

This is a total of 9 repos over 4 days. You can just go in the order listed in the `readme.md` in this folder.
- There are also optional quizzes, as per the `quizzes` directory of this repo. The quizzes say on them where they go.
