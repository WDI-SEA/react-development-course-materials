These are instructor notes to help guide a review discussion of [Film Project, Part 2](hhttps://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/blob/master/02-React%20State/12-film-project-part2.md).

**As you review, remember to ask students, "What questions do you have?" and not "Do you have any questions?"**


**Talking Points**:

- Events - are all of the click events firing and changing the ui? Have they stopped propagation?
- State - have they successfully added state and does the state change and update the ui when needed?
- Do students understand binding? Are all of their _this_ calls working accordingly?
- Talk through any sticking points. Were there any common "stuck" places?
