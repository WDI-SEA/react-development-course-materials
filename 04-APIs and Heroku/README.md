# react-apis-heroku

This is the 4th repo of the complete React module. It covers React APIs, fetch, and Heroku. 

Note that the Films Project is homework (but you can begin it in class). The full script of that lesson is student-facing (rather than embedded in the instructor Teaching Tips of Talking Points).
