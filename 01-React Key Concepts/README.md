# react-intro

This is the 1st repo of the complete React module.
This covers (1) Welcome to the course, (2) a review of the pre-work: ES6, components, JSX, virtual DOM, props, multiple props, and bog exercise, (3) nested components, (4) nested components challenge, (5) section recap, (6) Lord of The Rings codealong activity, (7) Newsfeed Component Lab, (8) Weather Icons Component Lab, and (9) Part 1 of an ongoing Films homework project.


Note that the Films Project is homework (but you can begin it in class). The full script of that lesson is student-facing (rather than embedded in the instructor Teaching Tips of Talking Points).
