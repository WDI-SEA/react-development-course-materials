# Instructors' Guide to teach the React Module

Note: The term "React Module" refers to all 8 React repos taught sequentially.

## Options on ways to teach the React Module
Note: See the `Readme.md` in the `schedules` folder for links to the repos and definitions of activity types.
1. Teach it like a normal class, entirely in classroom.
  - 5 days.
  - See `normal-schedule.md` in the `schedules` folder for an outline with timings.
2. Teach flipped classroom
  - This means assigning as much reading as possible for homework; all exercises and codealongs during the day.
  - For a schedule on teaching React flipped, follow the `flipped-classroom-schedule.md` in the `schedules` folder.

## Optional Quizzes and Review Guides
1. There are optionally short, ten question quizzes after each repo. These are linked in the `normal-schedule.md` and `flipped-classroom-schedule.md`. The quiz questions and links are in the `quizzes` folder.
  - These are not referenced in anything student facing and can optionally be assigned at your discretion.
  - **Note:** The review guides are linked at the end of the quizzes.
2. There are optionally review guides for a student to quickly reference in the future. These are located in [this repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/education-product/react-review-guides/).
  - These are not referenced in anything student facing and can optionally be shared at your discretion.

## Solution Locations
- All solutions to exercises, codealongs, and projects are located in this [repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/education-product/React-Exercise-Solutions).
  - Please note: this is a public repo. You can point students to it.
- This repo also contains the project prompts and starter code.
  - The projects build off one another, so the starter code is for your reference.
