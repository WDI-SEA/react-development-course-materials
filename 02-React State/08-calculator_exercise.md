Let's Build A Calculator!

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Now, it's time for you to check back on everything! You will be building a
calculator with React, and only minimal instructions have been provided for you to really think about what's happening.

- At first, your calculator will just add 2 numbers together when they are typed in. For the bonus, you might decide to get more creative.

</aside>

### Set Up and Step 1

`create-react-app`

<aside class="notes">

```html
<div className="container">
  <h1>Add with React!</h1>

  <div className="add">
    <input type="text" />
    <span>+</span>
    <input type="text" />
    <span>=</span>
    <h3>Addition results go here!</h3>
  </div>
</div>
```

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Use `create-react-app` to make a new project.

- Then, create a single component file in the `src` directory, and name it `Calculator.js`. In this file, create your `Calculator` class. Use the `App.js` as an example of how to create a basic component. Add the following JSX to your Calculator's `render()` function.

### Step 2

What state attributes will you need to track? 

What values should those state items start with? 

Where is that state displayed in the browser?

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Set up the initial state of your component. What state attributes will you
need to track? What values should those state items start with? Where is that
state displayed in the browser?

- Hint: You will only need one element in your state state.

</aside>

### Step 3

```js
class Calculator extends Component {
  // ...

  handleClick = (event) => {
    // Event logic here.
  }

  // ...
}
```

<details>

  <summary>More info about <em>bind</em></summary>

  You must explicitly `bind` functions with `this` in order for `this` to remain the same inside that function. If you're having trouble calling functions off `this` like `this.setState`, take time to consider why this is necessary and see if that leads you to, using the documentation, see how to do it.

```js
// This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
```

Revisit the To-Do List project to see how we previously reacted to changing
input text.

  <details>
    <summary>Hint: Where should the event binding go?</summary>
    In the same component as it's being used - in fact, right on the input.
  </details>
</details>


<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Add an event to the inputs so that you can trigger a function when their values
**change**. Consider: should it be a click event? A submit event? Something else?

- Here is a lot of documentation to help you choose what you want to do and how to do it:

1. [A list of events React supports](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#supported-events)
2. [React form documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html)
3. [How to handle events](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html)

- Remember that when you create an event, the function that you call should look something like what is seen here.

- Notice that the "How to handle events" link has an example using the `bind` keyword. This is an alternative and older way to handle events in React.

</aside>

### Step 4

Time to create a new method.

<details>

<summary>Hint: Where should this method go?</summary>
In the same component as it's being used - between the constructor and the render.
</details>

> Thought: How will you handle inputs that aren't numbers?

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Once you've chosen how to bind your inputs to an event, you'll need to create a
method. The method should accept the triggered event, get the input values from
your form, add them together, and set part of the state to the new `sum`.

</aside>

---

### Step 5

Et voil√†!

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Once the state of the `sum` has been set, React will re-render the whole
component. Make sure you have a place in your JSX that displays the result.

---

### Bonus

- Make the calculator work with any of the 4 basic arithmetic operations
  (+, -, \*, /). How will this change your `state` and your JSX?
