### Instructor Guide
# React Development

----

> This course introduces students to the basics of the React JavaScript library. 
## Overview

Students engage in hands-on, project-based learning. React Development students will:

- Explore new concepts and tools through expert-led lectures and discussions.
- Complete coding exercises to reinforce newly learned skills.
- Dive deeper into topics and techniques via programming labs.
- Receive individualized feedback and support from the instructional team.
- Apply what they've learned to build a custom React application.

## About This Guide

This guide contains links to a standard set of high quality resources for your use in teaching this course. But our goal is not to provide you with a script to follow; we hire practitioners at GA because we value what you bring to the classroom and want to encourage you to make adaptations.
Think of this guide as a cookbook. You, as the chef, will use the guidelines provided to craft an amazing meal for your students. But of course, you’ll want to think ahead about the various “dietary restrictions” and preferences of your “diners” as well as the type of “ambience” best suited to the type of experience you want to create.
Adaptations we encourage you to make:
- **Swapping out our generic examples for real-life examples from your industry experience.** The more you can speak to your own experience, the more the content will resonate with students.
- **Adapting suggested projects and activities to better challenge your students,** based on their level of prior knowledge and their interests.
- **Moving faster or slower as needed through the lessons based on the needs of your class.**


Adaptations we encourage you not to make without speaking with your manager first, especially during your first cohort:
- **Skipping over or cutting learning objectives.** Our curriculum is designed specifically to prepare students to a career in your industry. We’ve made a promise to them to get them job ready; when you skip content you’re putting their job readiness at risk.
- **Changing the scope of the course.** Try not to add new topics that distract from the core learning.
- **Radically altering the sequence of the course.** It’s okay to skip around sometimes, but try to follow the order of the units suggesting, especially during your first cohort.

>NOTE: If you haven’t already done so, be sure to complete the Instructor Course on myGA. The self-paced course provides a basic background in key concepts necessary for success leading a GA class.

When in doubt, discuss any planned changes to the curriculum you’d like to make with your manager, your fellow instructors, or a Global team member. Chances are, someone else can learn from or be inspired by your improvements!

## Course Details
React Development is a 40-hour course, delivered in either 5 day full-time or 10 week part time (two 2-hour sessions a week) format. Incoming students should have a familiarity with HTML and the Document Object Model (DOM), along with a working knowledge of JavaScript programming and functions, objects, arrays, and classes.


Once enrolled, students complete approximately 4 hours of pre-work on the myGA platform.

>NOTE: As an instructor, you should familiarize yourself with this pre-work so you can incorporate it in to your first lesson.

Your role as an instructor is to facilitate each student’s journey to mastery of the concepts outlined below. This guide will provide you with a suggested pacing guide you can use to ensure you hit all of the required objectives in a sequence that makes sense. **We recommend you follow the suggested pacing guide during your first instance.** Later on, as you become more familiar with the content and your own teaching style, you can remix and extend the lessons provided. Just be sure to cover all of the required topics that follow.

In order to graduate and earn a course completion certificate, every student must complete a final project that meets or exceeds the minimum standards outlined in the project rubric. Your manager will help you track other graduation requirements and make decisions about graduation.

### Learning Objectives
The high-level learning objectives for this course are:

- Explore the essentials of programming with React, including components, JSX, props, and state.
- Build multipage web applications using the popular React Router package.
- Create a custom, functioning web application.
- Embed an application programming interface (API) in a React application.
- Host a React application on Heroku to share with the world.

Students cannot graduate unless they demonstrate mastery of the above learning objectives before the end of the course. Mastery is measured through assessment: homeworks, in-class activities and final projects.

The official course syllabus, available PLACEHOLDER-ADD LINK outlines what must be covered in the course.

Optional topics you may consider adding on to extend learning (provided your students are ready) include:
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact)

# React Development: Types of Activities
Note: The term "React Module" refers to all 8 React repos taught sequentially.

### Types of Activities in the React Module:
- **Code-along**:
  - Students do this in class with you. You do it on the screen, and they follow along on their laptops.
  - All code-alongs can be instead assigned as exercises to the students to follow the instructions on their own.
- **Exercises**:
  - Exercises with instructions for students to do on their own.
  - Exercises can be run as code-alongs, with the exception of the blog and film projects.
- **Projects**:
  - Blog Project: There is a blog project that students build upon throughout the week. It starts in the Props pre-work lesson. Each exercise builds on the last until students have a functioning project by the end of the week. 
    - Each solution is a branch in the `react-blog-project` repo. (Each exercise's starter code is also in the repo, though students won't need that as the exercise is built throughout the class).
  - Film project: There is also a film project that students build upon throughout the week. Each exercise builds on the last until students have a functioning project by the end of the week. 
    - Each solution is a branch in the `react-film` repo. (Each exercise's starter code is also in the repo, though students won't need that as the exercise is built throughout the class).
    - A strong suggestion is to make each section of the project homework, but save time in class for questions.
    - This uses ES6 before it's introduced. Another option is to assign the first two film exercises together after the 6th ES6 lesson.
    - The film exercises are not referenced anywhere else in the class and can safely be ignored if you so choose.
- **Videos**:
  - Short (<3 min) videos explaining a topic.
- **Existing Repo Labs**:
  - There are two labs (ATM and TicTacToe) where students fork a repo with existing code and add features to it.
- **Self Project**:
  - The last repo is a self-project prompt. This is designed for a student to build their own website over the course of an entire day.


### Course Format
This course may be taught online or in-person, in a [10-week](#10-week-pacing) or [1-week format](#1-week-pacing).
