# React Module Breakdown
Note: The term "React Module" refers to all 8 React repos taught sequentially.

## Here are the links to the overall repos. Timings and file breakdowns are linked from the schedules in this folder.
- Repo 1: Intro to React.
  - This covers components, JSX, the virtual DOM, and props.
- Repo 2: State and recap exercises.
  - This covers state and has two recap exercises. Each can be run as either a codealong or an exercise. Recommended is a codealong for the first (todo list), and an exercise for the second (LoTR).
- Repo 3: ES6, functional components, and component lifecycle.
  - This covers ES6, functional components, and component lifecycle.
  - If students already know ES6, you can skip those two lessons.
- Repo 4: React Router
  - This covers single page applications, browser history mechanics, and React Router.
- Repo 5: APIs and Deployment.
  - This covers APIs, `fetch()`, imperative and declarative programming, and Heroku.
- Repo 6: ATM Exercise.
  - This is a project to assign to students. It's an existing ATM application that they will add a feature to. It's very simple; the goal is to introduce them to reading existing code.
- Repo 7: Tic Tac Toe exercise.
  - This is a more complicated existing tic tac toe application. They add a feature to it. This is the same tic tac toe exercise in the Facebook tutorial, which leads to...
- Repo 8: Documentation.
  - This explores the React documentation in detail. It walks through basic documentation, then there is a group project.
- Repo 9: Self project.
  - This is only a prompt which is a self project. This takes an entire day; students build their own website (or try to copy one like airBnB) from scratch. It includes researching a new topic on their own and adding that functionality.


## Types of Activities in the React Module:
- **Codealong**:
  - Students do this in class with you. You do it on the screen, and they follow along on their laptops.
  - All codealongs can be instead assigned to the students to follow the instructions on their own.
  - Codealong solutions are in the solutions repo referenced below.
- **Exercises**:
  - Exercises with follow along instructions for students to do on their own.
  - Exercise solutions are in the solutions repo referenced below.
  - Exercises can be run as codealongs.
- **Projects**:
  - There is a blog project that students build upon throughout the week - **the repos build on each other**. For example, at the end of the first repo (`react-intro`), they'll have a basic blog page with nested components. At the beginning of the second repo, (`react-state-and-intro-exercises`), they build on this basic blog page.
  - With that said, the prompt and starter code for each project exists in the solution repo referenced below.
- **Videos**:
  - Short videos explaining a topic. These are good opportunities for homework self study. A list of videos and their locations is in the `video-list.md` in this repo.
- **Existing Repo Projects**:
  - Linked in the schedule outlines, there are two projects where students fork a repo with existing code and add features to it.
- **Self Project**:
  - The last repo is a self-project prompt. This is designed for a student to build their own website over the course of an entire day.
