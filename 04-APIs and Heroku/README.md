This is Unit 4 of the complete React Development course. It includes the following:

1) **Review of Film Project, Part 3**: Discussion

2) **Introduction to APIs**: Interactive lecture

3) **Data Types**: Interactive lecture

4) **`fetch`**: Interactive lecture 

5) **Displaying the Weather**: Continuation of blog project

6) **Heroku**: Interactive lecture

7) **APIs, Heroku, and Imperative and Declarative Programming Quiz**: Online quiz

8) **Film Project, Part 4**: Class work + homework

Notes:

- The Film Project is homework (but you can begin it in class). The full script of that lesson is student-facing (rather than embedded in the instructor teaching tips or talking points).

- The quiz covers imperative and declarative programming in addition to APIs and Heroku. If you haven't covered all this material, don't assign the quiz.
