Note: anything that says "instructor can teach", the student can also just self study in class (as some of it has videos)


1. Beginning / Intro: Has options


Students do this at home, at night day 0 before day 1 of class
If you trust they can set up and begin self-work on their own.
Introduce the topic and walk them through the beginning at the end of another day (~1 hr), then any remainder is self work at home.
If they can self-work, but you want to make sure they can set it up
Move this below, to in class day 1
There is time on Day 1 to do this.


The work is:
The beginning (page 1) through "Props Challenge"
(~1.5 hrs of self work).

2. In class, day 1:
(or self work, day 0)


 Nested Components
instructor can teach
  Nested Components challenge
students do.
  Section recap

  Mordor recap exercise
a codealong for instructor to do with them.
(~1.5 hrs of class to this point)
  State

  State exercise challenge
students do.
  State lifecycle

(~1 hr this section, or 2.5 hrs of class total to this point)
  Todo list

(~1.5 hrs this section = 3 hrs class time total to this point)
  Recap
instructor teaches
  Calculator exercise
students do
(~1.5 hrs this section = 4.5 hours class time total to this point.)

Class time left to allow for questions or expansion.
If there's neither, no reason not to start ahead on the night's work.
Next is ES6, which they might already know, so if they do, maybe instructor gives a direction that they should still skim it for a recap.


Night 1, self-work:
ES6, Functional Components
(~1 hr)


In class, day 2:
Unidirectional flow, immutable data, section recap
instructor can teach. This is here ratinstructor than in self-work 1) to fill the day and 2) because it’s a difficult topic and there may be questions.
(~1 hr)
React router intro, browser history mechanics, modern history mechanics, react router intro
instructor can teach
(~45 min section, or 1.5hrs class total to here)
React Router dentist codealong (setup, preparing, adding in)
Codealong with instructor and students
(~1 hr section, or 2.5 hrs class total to here).
React router exercise
(students do)
(~1 hr section, or 3.5 hrs class total to here)

If time, can allow them to expand on their existing blog project if they want
Don't let them change home.js or movie.js, as those are modded in the next project
Also if time, can start the night work.


Night 2, self-work:
Intro to APIs, API response, fetch, fetch exercise
(~1 hr)


In class, day 3:
Fetch project
students do.
(~2 hrs).
Imperative vs Declarative
instructor can teach
(~½ hr, or 2.5 hrs to this point)
Quiz
instructor can teach as recap, group discussion, etc.
Self exercise project.
They are not capped at 3 hours, as it says, unless instructor wants them to be - just go to the end of the day.
Important Note on self exercise project: It says to submit project as zip file in google drive; have the students have some otinstructor way to get them to instructor (sharing their git repo or whatever).  GDrive doesn't support big uploads, we've learned.

Night 3, self-work:
Heroku (~2 hrs).

In class day 4:

All self exercises.

DONE.

--------

Notes if you are going to change the schedule and still teaching flipped:
Big exercises (so definitely in class) are:
The LoTR exercise after Nested Components Blog project (also worth doing in class)




 recap exercises (which works, because then the section reviews are also in class), the “todo list” codealong, “tic tac toe”, “ATM”, and “Self project”.
Project exercises (as in, the blog exercise ‘you dos’ that should probably be in class) are:
Props Challenge, Nested Components Challenge, State Exercise, Router Exercise, fetch project
If interested, here is the sheet with the actual timings from online pilots. You care about the bright blue.
Please request access from Susi Remondi if you can’t get to it

So to backtrack, I think they should do:
