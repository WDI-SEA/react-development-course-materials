## Overview
This lesson serves as the kick-off to your React Programming class. Whether you’re delivering this course online or in-person, in a 1-week accelerated for 10-week format, take the first hour or so of your time together to get things started on the right foot.

This lesson is designed to introduce yourself, GA, and get the students comfortable and excited to learn. Following that, there's a brief review of the pre-work.

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Define class expectations and norms.
- Understand key concepts introduced in the pre-work


## Duration
60 minutes


## Before Class: Preparation
- Update the slides that follow with specific information about you, your class, your city and your local support team.
- Take some time to consider your expectations for learners and be prepared to talk about them.
- Choose an ice breaker to run that will allow learners to get to know one another in a fun, informal, low-stakes way. We have a list [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a91IqhzijI_3EqU-trJbZN4vDDSU0rXqgIrqGwsWM7I/edit) of fun activities - and other good slides to copy - for the students for you to choose from. And if you have some good ones, feel free to share your ideas with us!
- Before class, review completion data to understand how far your learners have progressed through the myGA prework.
-- If most of your learners have completed all of the prework, you should be able to breeze through this lesson very quickly.
-- If most of your learners have not completed all of the prework, you might want to spend more time on this lesson and reduce your timings for the rest of the lessons in Unit 1.

## Some Key Features of React

- Declarative views: They make your code more readable and easier to debug.
- Virtual DOM: A virtual copy of the original DOM. Manipulating it (over the original DOM) speeds things up.
- Event Handling: No need to worry about incompatible event names and fields.
- JSX: Markup syntax you'll use for generating strings of HTML that are almost identical to the HTML you'll insert into the web page.
- React Native: A custom renderer for React.
- Component-Based: In React everything on the web page is divided into small components to create a view (or UIs). 
<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- On this and all below, don't just read the slides. Add in your own experience and thoughts.

</aside>

---

## When to Use React

- If your project involves many components with different, often changing states (active/inactive navigation items, accordion sections expanded/collapsed, dynamic inputs, buttons active/disabled, user login and access permissions).

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- If you know of any specific examples, talk about them!

</aside>

---

## When NOT to Use React

Other programming languages exist - React isn't great for everything! Avoid using React with:

- High performance needs.
- Devices with limited hardware capabilities.
- Web page widgets such as botsplash chat that are installed on 3rd party websites.

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- If you know of any specific examples, talk about them!





## Q&A and Summary

Any other questions?

Let's rock!

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Check to see if there  are any lingering questions on the course or GA.
