# React Module Breakdown
Note: The term "React Module" refers to all 8 React repos taught sequentially.

Links to the repos with specific notes are in the associated schedules.

### Types of Activities in the React Module:
- **Codealong**:
  - Students do this in class with you. You do it on the screen, and they follow along on their laptops.
  - All codealongs can be instead assigned as exercises to the students to follow the instructions on their own.
- **Exercises**:
  - Exercises with follow along instructions for students to do on their own.
  - Exercises can be run as codealongs, with the exception of the blog projects.
- **Projects**:
  - There is a blog project that students build upon throughout the week - - the solutions and exercises build on each other.
    - With that said, the prompt and starter code for each project exists in the solution repo referenced below.
  - There is also an optional film project that students build upon throughout the week - the solutions and exercises build on each other.
    - A strong suggestion is to make each section of the project homework to save time in class for questions, with the exception of the first, which is quite hard.
    - This uses ES6 before it's introduced.
    - The film exercises are not referenced anywhere else in the class and can safely be ignored if you so choose.
- **Videos**:
  - Short (<3 min) videos explaining a topic.
- **Existing Repo Projects**:
  - There are two projects (ATM and TicTacToe) where students fork a repo with existing code and add features to it.
- **Self Project**:
  - The last repo is a self-project prompt. This is designed for a student to build their own website over the course of an entire day.
