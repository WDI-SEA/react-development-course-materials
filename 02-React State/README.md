Notes:

- The Films Project is homework (but you can begin it in class). The full script of that lesson is student-facing (rather than embedded in the instructor Teaching Tips of Talking Points).

- The quiz is hosted on myGA. The file in this repo provides a url to slack to your students. The quiz is just for practice; the students do not need to log in; they platform will not record their scores.
