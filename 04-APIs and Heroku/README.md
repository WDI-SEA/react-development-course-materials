This is Unit 4 of the complete React Development Course. It includes the following:

1) **Introduction to APIs**: Interactive Lecture

2) **Data Types**: Interactive Lecture

3) `fetch`: Interactive Lecture 

4) **Displaying the Weather**: Exercise (continues with blog from pre-work)

5) **Heroku**: Interactive Lecture

6) **APIs, Heroku and Imperative and Declarative Programming Quiz**: Online Quiz

7) **Film Project, Part 4**: Classwork + Homework

Notes:

- The Films Project is homework (but you can begin it in class). The full script of that lesson is student-facing (rather than embedded in the instructor Teaching Tips of Talking Points).

- The Quiz covers Imperative and Declarative Programming in addition to APIs and Heroku. If you have not covered all this material, do not assign the quiz.
