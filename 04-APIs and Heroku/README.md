This is Unit 4 of the complete React Development Course. It includes the following:

1) **Review of Film Project, Part 3**: Discussion

2) **Introduction to APIs**: Interactive Lecture

3) **Data Types**: Interactive Lecture

4) `fetch`: Interactive Lecture 

5) **Displaying the Weather**: Continuation of Blog Project

6) **Heroku**: Interactive Lecture

7) **APIs, Heroku and Imperative and Declarative Programming Quiz**: Online Quiz

8) **Film Project, Part 4**: Classwork + Homework

9) **Optional API Dad Jokes Lab** (Available in [Extra Resources](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/tree/master/Additional%20Resources/Dad%20Jokes%20Lab) folder)

Notes:

- The Films Project is homework (but you can begin it in class). The full script of that lesson is student-facing (rather than embedded in the instructor Teaching Tips of Talking Points).

- The Quiz covers Imperative and Declarative Programming in addition to APIs and Heroku. If you have not covered all this material, do not assign the quiz.
