# Instructor Guide
## React Development

> This document is the source of all knowledge for the course. 
----

## Overview
This course introduces students to the basics of the React JavaScript library. In every unit, students engage in hands-on, project-based learning. 

React Development students will:

- Explore new concepts and tools through expert-led lectures and discussions.
- Complete coding exercises to reinforce newly learned skills.
- Dive deeper into topics and techniques via programming labs.
- Receive individualized feedback and support from the instructional team.
- Apply what they've learned to build a custom React application.

## About This Guide

This guide contains links to a standard set of high quality resources for your use in teaching this course. But our goal is not to provide you with a script to follow; we hire practitioners at GA because we value what you bring to the classroom and want to encourage you to make adaptations.
Think of this guide as a cookbook. You, as the chef, will use the guidelines provided to craft an amazing meal for your students. But of course, you’ll want to think ahead about the various “dietary restrictions” and preferences of your “diners” as well as the type of “ambience” best suited to the type of experience you want to create.
Adaptations we encourage you to make:
- **Swapping out our generic examples for real-life examples from your industry experience.** The more you can speak to your own experience, the more the content will resonate with students.
- **Adapting suggested projects and activities to better challenge your students,** based on their level of prior knowledge and their interests.
- **Moving faster or slower as needed through the lessons based on the needs of your class.**


Adaptations we encourage you not to make without speaking with your manager first, especially during your first cohort:
- **Skipping over or cutting learning objectives.** Our curriculum is designed specifically to prepare students to a career in your industry. We’ve made a promise to them to get them job ready; when you skip content you’re putting their job readiness at risk.
- **Changing the scope of the course.** Try not to add new topics that distract from the core learning.
- **Radically altering the sequence of the course.** It’s okay to skip around sometimes, but try to follow the order of the units suggesting, especially during your first cohort.

>NOTE: If you haven’t already done so, be sure to complete the Instructor Course on myGA. The self-paced course provides a basic background in key concepts necessary for success leading a GA class.

When in doubt, discuss any planned changes to the curriculum you’d like to make with your manager, your fellow instructors, or a Global team member. Chances are, someone else can learn from or be inspired by your improvements!

## Course Details
React Development is a 40-hour course, delivered in either a 5-day full-time or a 10-week part-time (two 2-hour sessions per week) format. Incoming students should have a familiarity with HTML and the Document Object Model (DOM), along with a working knowledge of JavaScript programming and functions, objects, arrays, and classes.


Once enrolled, students complete approximately 4 hours of pre-work on the myGA platform. As an instructor, you should familiarize yourself with this pre-work so you can review and discuss it in the first lesson.

Your role as an instructor is to facilitate each student’s journey to mastery of the concepts outlined below. This guide will provide you with a suggested pacing guide you can use to ensure you hit all of the required objectives in a sequence that makes sense. **We recommend you follow the suggested pacing guide during your first instance.** Later on, as you become more familiar with the content and your own teaching style, you can remix and extend the lessons provided. Just be sure to cover all of the required topics that follow.

In order to graduate and earn a course completion certificate, every student must complete a final project that meets or exceeds the minimum standards outlined in the project rubric. Your manager will help you track other graduation requirements and make decisions about graduation.

### Learning Objectives
The high-level learning objectives for this course are:

- Explore the essentials of programming with React, including components, JSX, props, and state.
- Build multipage web applications using the popular React Router package.
- Create a custom, functioning web application.
- Embed an application programming interface (API) in a React application.
- Host a React application on Heroku to share with the world.

Students cannot graduate unless they demonstrate mastery of the above learning objectives before the end of the course. Mastery is measured through assessment: homeworks, in-class activities, and final projects.

The official course syllabus, available PLACEHOLDER-ADD LINK outlines what must be covered in the course.

Optional topics you may consider adding on to extend learning (provided your students are ready) include:
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact)


### Types of Activities in the React Development Course:

- **Interactive Lectures**: 
  - These are lectures that you present to the students. Some have mini code-alongs or exercises baked in. You will also find assets such as videos, charts, and discussion prompts in these lesson decks. **Talking Points** and **Teaching Tips** can be found in the presenter notes (not student-facing). Note that if a student downloads a PDF of these decks, they will not get the presenter notes. Students should be encouraged to take their own notes as they participate in the lecture.
  
  - Also note that slide content is sparse - each slide displays just a code snippet, an image, a chart, a bulletpoint list. You get to explain the content and expand upon it. There are plenty of notes in the presenter-note field to guide you.
  - [Interactive Lecture Example](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/blob/master/01-React%20Key%20Concepts/03-nested-components.md)
  
  
- **Exercises**:
 
  - Exercises are coding challenges with student-facing instructions. There are hints and some suggested talking points in the presenter notes (not student facing). Read these over carefully and decide how much info you will provide to the students prior to their starting the exercise.
  - Exercises generally take about 30 minutes to complete.
  - The most flexible of the activity types! Use them as solo work, partner work, or group work. Do them in class or assign them as homework. Also note, with the exception of the blog and film projects, exercises can also be run as code-alongs.

  - [Exercise Example](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/blob/master/01-React%20Key%20Concepts/04-nested-components-exercise.md)

  
  
- **Code-alongs**:
  - Students do this in class with you. You do it on the screen, and they follow along on their laptops. The slide decks with the code-along activities provide you with a few slides to project and introduce the topic (the rest of the deck is a run-through of the code-along, for instructor reference only). 
  - There are two designated code-alongs in this course: The Lord of the Rings Code-Along in Unit 1 (approximate time to complete is 30 minutes), and the Idea Board code-along in Unit 6 (approximate time to complete is 60 minutes).
  - [Code-Along Example](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/blob/master/01-React%20Key%20Concepts/06-lotr-code-along.md)
  
  
- **Labs**:
  - There are two labs (ATM and TicTacToe), in which students fork a repo with existing code and add features to it.
  - Labs take approximately 90 minutes to complete.
  - [Lab Example](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/blob/master/Additional%20Resources/ATM%20Lab/README.md)

- **Projects**:
  - Blog Project: This is a blog project that students build upon throughout the week. It starts in the [Props pre-work lesson](https://my.generalassemb.ly/preview?lessonURL=https://ga-create-api.s3.amazonaws.com/props-3145.json). Each phase of the project builds on the last until students have a functioning project. 
  - Film project: There is also a film project that students build upon throughout the week (5-day delivery) or first few weeks (10-week delivery). Each exercise builds on the last until students have a functioning project. 
  - Final Project: This is designed for a student to build their own website over the course of an entire day (1-week delivery) or a week (10-week delivery).
