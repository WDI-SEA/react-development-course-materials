# React Module Breakdown
Note: The term "React Module" refers to all 8 React repos taught sequentially.

Links to the repos with specific notes are in the associated schedules.

### Types of Activities in the React Module:
- **Codealong**:
  - Students do this in class with you. You do it on the screen, and they follow along on their laptops.
  - All codealongs can be instead assigned to the students to follow the instructions on their own.
  - Codealong solutions are in the solutions repo referenced below.
- **Exercises**:
  - Exercises with follow along instructions for students to do on their own.
  - Exercise solutions are in the solutions repo referenced below.
  - Exercises can be run as codealongs.
- **Projects**:
  - There is a blog project that students build upon throughout the week - **the repos build on each other**. For example, at the end of the first repo (`react-intro`), they'll have a basic blog page with nested components. At the beginning of the second repo, (`react-state-and-intro-exercises`), they build on this basic blog page.
  - With that said, the prompt and starter code for each project exists in the solution repo referenced below.
- **Videos**:
  - Short videos explaining a topic. These are good opportunities for homework self study.
- **Existing Repo Projects**:
  - Linked in the schedule outlines, there are two projects where students fork a repo with existing code and add features to it.
- **Self Project**:
  - The last repo is a self-project prompt. This is designed for a student to build their own website over the course of an entire day.
- **Homework**:
  - There is a film project throughout the course that students build upon throughout the week. The solutions are branches in the repo students will fork. A strong suggestion is to make each section of the project homework to save time in class for questions.
