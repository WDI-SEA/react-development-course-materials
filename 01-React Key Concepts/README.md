This is Unit 1 of the complete React Development Course. It includes the following:

1) **Welcome to React Development**: Interactive Lecture

2) **Review of the Pre-work**: Discussion 

3) **Nested Components**: Interactive Lecture 

4) **Nested Components**: Continuation of Blog Project

5) **Section Recap**: Discussion

6) **Lord of The Rings**: Code-Along

7) **Creating a Newsfeed Component**: Exercise

8) **Creating a WeatherIcons Component**: Exercise

9) **Intro to React.js**: Quiz

9) **Film Project, Part 1**: Classwork + Homework

Notes:

- The quiz is on my GA. The quiz file in this repo is a readme with instructions on how to administer the quiz, as well as a question-by-question walkthrough for ease of reviewing with students.

- The Films Project is homework (but you can begin it in class). The full script of that lesson is student-facing (rather than embedded in the non-student facing presenter notes as with other activities).
