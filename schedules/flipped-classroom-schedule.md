#### Flipped classroom.

"Flipped Classroom" means as much reading as possible for homework to still fill the days with exercises. This does not mean there are not lectures during the class, but fewer.

This schedule groups lectures together (for homework reading) and exercises together.
  - This means that instead of, for example, a JSX lecture, then a JSX exercise, then a DOM lecture, then a DOM exercise (as in the normal schedule), students would read the JSX and DOM lecture together at night, then do the JSX and DOM exercise together during the day.
  - This might not be desirable if students are easily lost and need immediate practice.

**Timing**: It is listed below as 3 days with one hour on day 0.
  - Allot a fourth day for bleed over in case of many questions.
  - If enough instructors tell me (Susi) timings are significantly off, I'll change it, so let me know.

Only specific lessons with notes are called out below, but unless stated otherwise, do **every** lesson in order!
  - Note: Anything that isn't specifically called out below can be self study (students sit quietly and read) or instructor led.

Begin: [Repo 1: react-intro](../../../../react-intro). Repo 1 covers components, JSX, the virtual DOM, and props.

1. **Day 0: The afternoon. ~1 hour before end of day.**
  - Introduce the topic and walk them through the beginning at the end of another day (~1 hr) - as much as you get through before the day ends. You need to get through at least lesson 2.
  - The goal is to be sure everyone has `create-react-app` up and running before sending them home.


2. **Day 0: Homework. (<1.5 hrs of self work).**
  - Through Lesson 9 - Multiple props passed from an object


3. **Day 1, class time.**

  - Start on lesson 10.
  - Specific notes to call out:
    - Lesson 10: Props challenge.
      - This is the first of the blog projects.
      - The student does this individually.
    - Lesson 12: Nested Components challenge
      - Is the second of the blog projects.
      - This builds off the previous project. Students do not need starter code.
      - The student does this individually.
    - Lesson 14 (LoTR codealong):
      - Work as a codealong as it comes before an exercise. It builds a simple React app from scratch. Solution in branch.
    - Lesson 15 (film exercise)
      - This is the first film exercise. Have students work alone or in pairs.


  - [Quiz 1 is here](../quizzes/quiz-1-after-LoTR.md)
    - **optional** at the end of the repo.

**Still in day 1, class time**:

Starting [Repo 2: react-state-exercises](../../../../react-state-exercises), which covers state and has two recap exercises.

Timing: Lessons 1-3; 1.5 hours. lessons 4 - 5: 1.5 hours. Lessons 6 - 7: 1.5 hours together. Quiz 2: 15min.

  - Lesson 1 - State
    - has a video.
    - has a quick exercise at the end. Solution is in a branch.
  - Lesson 2 - State Project
    - Is the third of the blog projects. This has a bonus activity as well.
    - The student does this individually.
    - This builds off the previous project. Students do not need starter code.
  - Lesson 4 - ToDo Exercise
    - An exercise to build a todo list from scratch. Can be a codealong or a self exercise for students.
    - Recommended as a codealong, where you go through it with students.
    - No solution code - it continues in the next file.
  - Lesson 5 - ToDo Exercise Continued
    - Continues the above ToDo List.
    - Solution is in a branch.
  - Lesson 6 - Recap
    - Best practices up to this point. Has a video.

- From Repo 2:
  - Lesson 7 - Calculator Exercise
    - Exercise for students to go through on their own.
    - Has a bonus at bottom.
    - Solution is in a branch.
  - Lesson 8 - Film Exercise, Part 2: State

- In [Repo 3: react-es6-functional](../../../../react-es6-functional), which covers ES6, functional components, and component lifecycle. All ES6 exercises are in linked CodePens.   
  - Students do beginning of repo through and including lesson 8.5, functional components solution - **skipping 6.5, the third film project**.
  - If you've previously covered ES6, students can skip to lesson 6 (the ES6 recap and exercise)


**Day 3: Class time.**
- Timing: The rest of Repo 3: ~1 hours; Quiz 3: 15min.
- Finish repo 3 (start on lesson 9; run through lesson 12 - not lesson 13)
- [Quiz 3 is here](../quizzes/quiz-3-after-immutable-data.md).
  - **Optionally**, can be given at end of lesson.

Then, begin [Repo 4: react-router](../../../../react-router).  
- Specific timings for repo 4:  
  - Lessons 1-4: ~30 min
  - Lessons 5-7: Codealong. ~1hr.
  - Lesson 8: ~1 hr.
  - Quiz: 15min.

Notes: Lesson 8:
    - Lesson 8 is the fourth of the blog projects.
    - Students do this on their own.

- Then, [Quiz 4 is here](../quizzes/quiz-4-after-router-exercise.md).
  - **Optionally**, can be given at end of lesson.

**Day 2 homework:**

- Repo 3, Lesson 13 - Film Exercise, Part 3: Lifting State Up.


**Day 3: class**

[Repo 5: react-apis-heroku-declarative](../../../../react-apis-heroku-declarative). up through (not including) lesson 7 (Heroku). ~2 hrs.

- Go over fetch project solution. It's the last of the blog projects.

- [Repo 6: ATMReact](https://github.com/susiremondi/ATMReact). Timing: 1 hour.
  - This is a lab to assign to students. It's an existing ATM application that they will add a feature to. It's very simple; the goal is to introduce them to reading existing code.
    - The repo readme has instructions on it, so you can point students to it and optionally run over the instructions with them.
    - Note: Hosted on Susi's regular github. Eventual plan to clone over.

- [Repo 7: tictacReact](https://github.com/susiremondi/tictacReact). Timing: 1 hour.
  - This is a more complicated lab - an existing tic tac toe application. They add a feature to it. This is the same tic tac toe exercise in the Facebook tutorial, which segues to the next repo.
    - The repo readme has instructions on it, so you can point students to it and optionally run over the instructions with them.
    - Note: Hosted on Susi's regular github. Eventual plan to clone over.

- [Repo 8: react-documentation](../../../../react-documentation). Timing for repo: 1 hour.
  - This explores the React documentation on Facebook in detail.
  - Lesson 1 (~1/2 hr):
    - Has an exercise at the button for students to walk through. The solution is linked below that in a CodePen.
      - If enough instructors ask, I will move this solution from the CodePen into the solution repo so it isn't on the page.
  - Lesson 2 (~1/2 hr):
    - Is a group exercise for students to research in the documentation, then give a presentation.



**Homework day 3; all of day 4:**

[Repo 9: Self project.](../../../../react-self-project) This continues till end of day 5.
  - This is only a prompt which is a self project. This takes an entire day; students build their own website (or try to copy one like airBnB) from scratch. It includes researching a new topic on their own and adding that functionality.
